        <b>HOUSTON, Nov. 19, 2015</b> – Powered by PROS, CodeRED is a weekend-long programming competition that empowers students to learn and innovate. CodeRED will be providing an all-inclusive makerspace with all the resources needed to help showcase their coding abilities, experiment with new technologies, solve real-world problems, make ideas come to life, and allow students to interact with leading technology companies such as PROS and Microsoft. 
        <br><br>
        With over 600 students participating and 1000 attendees, CodeRED has become the one of the largest technology events in Houston and one of the largest innovation events nationwide. The event is sanctioned by Major League Hacking (MLH), the official collegiate hackathon league.
        <br><br>
        <i>“PROS headquarters is in Houston, and we are proud to be the lead sponsor for the CodeRED event in our hometown,”</i> said <b>PROS Senior Vice President of Product Development Ajay Damani</b>. <i>“PROS culture of innovation enables employees to deliver a material and measureable business impact that helps companies and individuals outperform. PROS is a great destination for the technology leaders of the future. We look forward to seeing the students’ innovative ideas in action.”</i>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Sponsored by industry innovation leaders, empowering student innovators</h3>
        <br>
        Thanks to the generous contributions and support of over a dozen sponsors, CodeRED will be able to provide an experience like no other and all the resources needed for students to innovate.
        <br><br>
        Our co-host, PROS, a revenue and profit realization company, is powering CodeRED to expose the tech leaders of tomorrow to the cutting-edge technology and knowledge needed to solve issues companies are facing in the global business climate. Their challenge for this event will be for students to create the best use of data visualization to make big data sets easier to understand and interact with.
        <br><br>
        In addition, other sponsors such as Microsoft, Pariveda Solutions, and BlueChasm will be presenting challenges for attendees to attempt such as Best use of Microsoft Technologies and Best use of Cloud Computing. These companies will also be providing company representatives as mentors to the students attempting their challenges.
